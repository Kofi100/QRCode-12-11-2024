## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Not much right now,just repractising and training my skill to translate Figma designs to flexible HTML webpages.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

```
```css

```
```js
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I think I will have to start using Figma more to design websites on my own to polish my skill on designing websites.
